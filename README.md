# Overview

The Tractive System Discharge Module (TSDM_2017) discharges the tractive system in accordance with the 2017 Formula SAE rules. It uses two MOSFETs and a power resistor to discharge the repackaged inverter filtering capacitors below 60V in around 1.3 seconds (to meet EV5.1.3). The power resistor is designed to be always connected across the tractive system when the AIR shutdown circuit is open, even when the vehicle is off.

# Overview

The Tractive System Discharge Module (TSDM_2017) discharges the tractive system in accordance with the 2017 Formula SAE rules. It uses two MOSFETs and a power resistor to discharge the repackaged inverter filtering capacitors below 60V in <1.5 seconds (to meet EV5.1.3). The power resistor is designed to be connected across the tractive system whenever the AIR shutdown circuit is open, even when the vehicle is off.
